		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It is about 4 hours from Paris by TGV. The beautiful village, <strong>Annecy</strong>, is situated near the border which is shared with Switzerland and Italy. Since I saw a picture of the town in a guide book, I have always wanted to visit there. And finally the day came.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/admin%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="178" height="235" /><br />
Map of Savoie: click <a href="../../imgs/ANNECY/admin.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>In the summer of 2006, my husband and I were on the train bound for Annecy. His parents already arrived at Annecy Station from Marseille, and we started a one-week trip in the Alps.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230023%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230026%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>After walking a little from the station, a panoramic view came into my sight. This is a park called <strong>Champ de Mars. </strong>Many people were enjoying their holidays peacefully and tranquilly. Some people were playing sports, some swimming in the lake (it is banned, though), and some other people were taking a nap on the grass. I was so excited to see the grand nature that I could hardly control my excitement!</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230027%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230030%20(WinCE).html" alt="anncy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>It is indeed picturesque. What a place!, I wonder how many times I said so in my mind. I was shocked by the beauty and the blue of Lake Annecy and the sky. Behind the lake are the Alps.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230029%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230031%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>Colorful boats are floating on the clear water. The water is so clear that you can see the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230033%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230034%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>We walked around the park and came back where we started. The building in the right-hand picture is <strong>Le Chateau d’Annecy</strong> (the Annecy Castle), which was built by a baron in Savoie in 1445.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230015%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230014%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>The inside of the city is full of flowers, and all the buildings are also colorfully painted. Annecy (or Savoie prefecture) is well-known as a city of flowers. That’s why in all directions there are a lot of flowers, and the elaborate landscape pleases our eyes. I can’t imagine people are really living in such pretty houses.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230039%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230038%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>These pictures were taken in the old town, and the canal called<strong> La Thiou </strong>runs through it. I hear that this is the most popular spot in France for taking a picture. The building in the center is <strong>Le Palais de l’isle</strong> (the island palace), which was built by a feudal lord in the 12th century. It has a long history. It was once a city hall, a court, a mint bureau, and a prison. It was playing many roles, and now it is used as a history museum.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230041%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230042%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>Of course, many cafés and restaurants are standing along the river. You can enjoy Savoie food (famous for ham).</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230017%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7230016%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>This is <strong>Saint Piere Cathedral</strong>. Annecy is also known as a place where Jean-Jacques Rousseau was living when he was between 16 and 27 years old. It is also well-known that he played the flute at this cathedral.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/ANNECY/P7300038%20(WinCE).html" alt="annecy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>And don’t forget Annecy chocolate. We bought a lot at a shop named <strong>Meyer: </strong>4, Place Saint Francois (tel) 04 50 45 12 08</p>
<p>It was a wonderful summer vacation. One of the best vacation trips in my life, and one of my favorite places in France. If you wish to escape from a busy urban life, this is one of the options!</p>

		<p>Jarsy is a village where I spent my summer vacation with my family. Savoie prefecture is spotted with such small villages everywhere, and there are many inns and B&amp;Bs. My husband’s father found a cottage for this trip soon after Christmas last year!! Here people start to think about their summer plan when they are eating a Christmas dinner!!!</p>
<p>Leaving Paris early in the morning, we arrived at Annecy around noon. It is a 4 hours’ ride on TGV, and then we drove to Jarsy, taking one and a half hour. It was a fun ride in the nature. No buses, no trains around. All the roads meander in the mountains, so every time the car turned, a different landscape came into my sight.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/Jarsy/P7230048%20(WinCE).html" alt="jarsy" width="240" height="180" /></p>

<p>The picture on the left shows Lake Annecy in the distance. We were going up the mountain. I don’t remember how many mountains we passed, but I do remember I met many cows and horses on the way. One cow was approaching me with curiosity when I got out of the car. And a few minutes later, one horse came to us gently, and my husband’s mother petted him. It is incredible that they don’t get scared by humans. I was a little scared, to be honest…</p>
<p>But, just in case, don’t touch the fence, because there is electricity running!</p>

<p>After saying goodbye to the animals, we kept driving, and here it’s our destination, Jarsy. Nothing but nature. Very quiet and calm. I seldom saw people, either. All what I could hear was the bell sounds of cows. At night, silence pervaded all around, and in the sky were a myriad of stars. I hadn’t seen so many stars that close for a long time. The last time I saw such a bright sky was maybe when I was an elementary school student. Seeing the twinkling stars, I felt that our earth was floating in space.</p>

<p>This is the cottage we stayed in for one week. It was newly built, so it still smelled of fresh wood. Luckily, we were the first visitors. 400 euros for one week.</p>
<p>Well, one problem we had was horseflies. They attacked us a lot. We bought an insecticide, but I got 3 bites. They even entered the cottage, and we all ran about! It was very funny.</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/Jarsy/P7230081%20(WinCE).html" alt="jarsy" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>For dinner, we had specialties of Savoie, that is, wine and ham. My husband’s parents found them at an open-air market. It was, of course, delicious.</p>

<p>This is the open-air market. They sell fresh vegetables and fruit. I bought a lot of apricots and melons. They are my favorite. Especially melons are good with Savoie ham!!</p>

<p>I had a really good time there with my family. These photos always remind me of the days when I was there, and I now miss the bell sounds.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Giverny</strong> is the village where a great master of impressionism, Monet, got inspiration for his art work. It is located 88 km north-west from Paris.</p>
<p><strong>How to Get There </strong></p>
<p>Take a train bound for Rouen or the likes at Saint-Lazare station in Paris, and get off the train at <strong>Vernon</strong>. The time varies depending on the train. Some trains don’t stop at every station, taking about 45 minutes, while others may take 1.5 hours. And so does the thicket price. Some discounts are given, according to the day and the time. Check more information at <a href="http://www.voyages-sncf.com/leisure/fr/launch/home/">SNCF</a>.</p>
<p>When you arrive at Vernon, you have 3 choices to get to Monet’s museum. First, by bus. There is a bus stop near the station. Second, by bicycle. This was our option. Since it was a beautiful day, we liked to do a little exercise outside. There are two cafes in front of the station, and they are renting bicycles ( 10 euros a day for one bicycle). I’ll say, by bicycle you can enjoy more things than when you use a bus, because a path for cyclists is provided and it runs through the nature. It was really great. And the third choice is on foot. If your schedule is not tight, it’s also possible.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090001%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090067%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p>Just go straight on this path (the picture above on the left). I didn’t see many people on that day, because it was a little early in the morning, but in the afternoon there were people walking, cycling, roller-braiding, or reading on the bench.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes or so, pedaling on and off, I found the street named “<strong>Rue Claude MONET</strong>.” This is the start of a very calm village, Giverny. Some houses are holding a sign “B&amp;B,” or “Fresh Cider.” People here are living a really tranquil life. And Monet’s house is almost there.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090068%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p>This church stands on the same street, and next to the building Monet is sleeping quietly surrounded by numerous flowers.</p>
<p><strong>Monet’s Atelier</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we arrived at Monet’s house. It was still around 10 o’clock in the morning, but many people were waiting in line in front of the ticket gate. Parking our bicycles, we hurried to get in the line, and waited and waited. We may have taken too much time on the way. After paying €5.50 for the ticket, we entered the building, and down the staircase was a souvenir shop. Various goods with a logo “Monet” are sold there, and it was hard for me to resist the temptation, just like other visitors. Everyone needs something to prove that he has been to the place! My husband and I bought a calendar for 2008!! But don’t waste too much time there!!</p>
<p>Then, we came into Monet’s garden. My first impression there was “how picturesque!”</p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090020%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090028%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090029%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090030%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090059%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090022%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p>Look at those beautiful flowers. How wonderful it would be to live in such a house filled with colorful flowers! The scent of flowers is wafting in the wind and calms people’s minds. When we visited there, it was April, and we saw many tulips, pansies and daffodils. If I had a chance to live in such an environment, I would feel like painting a picture every day.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090008%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p>This is Monet’s Atelier painted in pink and green. It is definitely a part of the garden, or maybe the garden is a part of the atelier. They are a perfect match.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090010%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p>Inside the building are a number of Japanese Ukiyoe prints (ukiyoe is a woodblock color print). Monet was admiring Ukiyoe art, saying that it has many movements in it. Some prints show an American, a British, a Dutch, a Portuguese, and a Russian, who visited Japan in the late 17th century, and many westerners are looking at them with curiosity in the modern time.</p>
<p>Then, outside again, but this time the landscape is totally different. This is the place where Monet started to work on his grand art work, “<strong>Waterlilies</strong>,” which later made him famous. It is now viewed by many people at <a href="../../tourism_en/oragerie.html">Orangerie Museum</a> in Paris.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090034%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090035%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>

<p><img src="../../../../imgs/giverny/P4090036%20%5b320x200%5d-2.js" /></p>
<p>To create this beautiful Water Garden, Monet had to ask for permission to dig ponds, and later he also built the elegant Japanese Bridge, now entirely restored. Taking a stroll in this garden may make you feel like you are walking in the painting.</p>
<p>I was fully enjoying the beauty on the bench for a while.</p>

		<p><strong>History of Provence</strong>:</p>
<p>It has been proven that in Provence human beings were already making their homes in the rocks and living in there in 10,000 B.C. The Greeks began to intrude into Provence in 600 B.C. and the Phoceens built Massalia Kingdom, the base of Marseille. They were trading with many cities and towns around the Mediterranean Sea and brought their kingdom a big prosperity. In the 1st century the Romans appeared in the history of this region. There were many battles and conflicts, and many different peoples invaded the Provence. Finally Massalia went under the control of the Frank Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 13th century the King of France, Louis VIII surrounded Avignon, and in 1229 a treaty was contracted in Paris. The region became the land of the King. Moreover, in 1274 the Vatican was moved to Avignon from Rome, so the city was greatly developed.</p>
<p>Later, people in Provence had a hard time of battles again, but in January 1974 finally the region was governed by being divided into Provence, Alpes and Cote-d’Azure.</p>
<p><strong>Culture of Provence:</strong></p>
<p>Many cultural heritages remain in Provence, and many artists also came and created many art works. You can name some of the artists like Gogh, Picasso, Mathis, and Cezanne. Those people were all attracted by the beauty of Provence.</p>
<p><strong>La petanque</strong> (a sport using an iron ball: the picture below) and<strong> Ferias</strong> (bull fighting) are good examples to show their traditional culture, too. Especially la petanque is very unique. You see people playing “la petanque” everywhere in Marseille. There are some big competitions, too.</p>
<p>And they have wonderful craft work. Provence textile and earthenware (usually with prints of sunflowers or olives) are must-buy when you visit there. They are so beautiful and nice. Here is a site I found for on-line shopping;</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/petanque.html" alt="Petanque" width="250" height="181" /></p>
<p><strong>Santon dolls</strong> (see <a href="../../culture_fr-en/christmas.html">Christmas</a>) are everywhere in Marseille when Christmas is nearing.</p>
<p>People in Provence also have an accent in their French too. Compared to the Parisian accent, the Provence accent sounds more friendly because of the atmosphere of the region which is always warm and sunny.</p>
<p><strong>Marseille:</strong></p>
<p>Marseille is the oldest city in Provence which was built by the Phoceens in 600 B.C. and since then it has been in prosperity as a successful marine trader. When ships and boats were the only way to travel across the ocean, Marseille was the first place in France for Japanese visitors to arrive. Even now it possesses the biggest port in France, and the second-biggest city following Paris.</p>
<p>The main port is called <strong>Le Vieux Port (Old Port)</strong>. There are many yachts and pleasure boats at anchor, and there are also many restaurants and cafés around the port. You can enjoy their specialty,” bouillabaisse.” And the big street which starts from the port is called <strong>La Canebiere</strong>, where you can find many shops and hotels. On top of the hill is<strong> Notre-Dame-De-La-Garde</strong>. From there you can look over the whole city. It’s a scenic point. Don’t forget to bring your camera.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/vieux-port.html" alt="Vieux-Port" width="250" height="173" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/cannebiere.html" alt="Cannebiere" width="250" height="172" /><strong><br />

<p>Then you may want to take an excursion boat. It will give you refreshing air, too. Buy a ticket at the old port and you will arrive at <strong>the chateau d’If (If castle)</strong> in twenty minutes or so. It was built as a fortress by the King of France, François I, in the 16th century for the purpose of protecting Marseille from enemies at sea. However, it was never functioned as it was expected. Instead, it became legendary for its prisoners, both real—a rhinoceros immortalized by Durer in 1515—and imaginary—Alexander Dumas’s Count of Monte Cristo. The well-preserved environment and building make the chateau d’If one of the Mediterranean’s most outstanding sites.</p>
<p>After studying the ghost castle, or you can say “a prison,” go back to the boat again, and you will reach<strong> Iles de Frioul</strong> <strong>(Frioul Island)</strong>. This island was occupied by the Germans during the World War II, but Marseille City retrieved it in 1971. There are not many sightseeing points, but the nature here is preserved intact. My favorite point is a small inlet where people enjoy swimming in summer. It’s very quiet and peaceful.</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/frioul.html" alt="Frioul" width="250" height="167" /><strong><br />
Chateau d’If and </strong><strong>Ile du Frioul</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in the history, you should visit <strong>Musee d’histoire de Marseille </strong>which is located in the department store, Centre Bourse. On the ground floor they show some old posters and articles about Savon de Marseille. Marseille is also famous for its soap which is made from olives. When you go downstairs, you will find a bigger space for more historic items and learn how old their history is. There is a replica boat too, and it shows how people were sailing before, and some mummies tell you how the life was at the ancient time. It’s surprising that such a museum exists in the department store.</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/Museum%20garden.html" alt="Museum Garden" width="240" height="180" /><br />
The entrance is located in the department store, Centre Bourse.<br />
The ruin was found when the department store was built. Now it is preserved as a park.</p>
<p>There are many shops, cafés and restaurants around Le Vieux Port. If you are a fan of soccer, there is your kind of café, called<strong> L’OM cafe</strong>. Marseille is also known for its big soccer team, L’OM.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/L%27OM%20cafe.html" alt="OM Cafe" width="240" height="180" /></p>

<p>Speaking of eating, you can’t miss <strong>bouillabaisse</strong>. It is the specialty of this city. For your information, I’ll give you some good restaurant names.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/miramar.html" alt="Miramar" width="240" height="180" /><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.bouillabaisse.com/">MIRAMAR</a></strong> It is located at Le Vieux Port. They say it is the best restaurant for bouillabaisse.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/MICHEL.html" alt="Michel" width="240" height="180" /><br />
<strong>MICHEL </strong>another recommended restaurant for bouillabaisse.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/Petit%20Nice.html" alt="Petit Nice" width="240" height="180" /><br />
<strong>Le Petit Nice PASSDAT </strong>This restaurant has the best view of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/le%20RHUL.html" alt="Le Rhul" width="240" height="180" /><br />
<strong>Le RHUL</strong> This is one of the most beautiful and famous hotels in Marseille.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to visit their beautiful Mediterranean Sea. Here are some photos I took in “December.” Yes, it is possible to sunbathe there in winter! (If you are lucky)</p>

There are several hiking courses there.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a souvenir shop in Marseille somehow. The one I found near the port had Provençal goods.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../imgs/marseille/provance%20souvenir-2.js" /><br />
I bought luncheon mats and towels.<br />
The design always reminds me of Provence and makes me feel warm, even though I’m living in Paris.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediterranean-interiors.com/index.htm"><img src="../../imgs/souvenirs/BAR030%20(WinCE).html" alt="earthenwear" width="170" height="167" /></a><br />
Or you can do online shopping! I found a cool website for Provence lovers.<br />
<a href="http://www.mediterranean-interiors.com/index.htm">Mediterranean Interiors</a></p>
<p>One more thing I’d like to mention here is <strong>Cassis</strong> and <strong>Calanques</strong>. Cassis is a typical small fishing port in Provence. There is an old saying; Even if you’ve been to Provence it’s almost like you’ve seen nothing if you haven’t seen Cassis. “Calanque” means an inlet with a nice calm beach surrounded by rocks.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/cassis.html" alt="Cassis" width="250" height="171" /><br />
<strong>Cassis</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/marseille/calanques1.html" alt="Calanques" width="250" height="175" /> <img src="../../imgs/marseille/calanques2.html" alt="Calanques" width="250" height="174" /><br />
<strong>Calanques </strong></p>
<p>I hope you will have a chance to visit Provence someday. It is not only Paris, but many nice places around. Maybe much more exciting than Paris. Nice weather, nice air, nice food, and friendly people.</p>

		<p>The place where Auguste Renoir (1841~1919) met a woman for life</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/malmaison/river.html" alt="river" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>“I’ve been staying in Chatou for painting for a long time. Come and visit me here for lunch one time. You won’t regret doing so. This is the most beautiful place in the suburbs of Paris,” wrote Renoir in a letter to his friend. It is only 15 minutes from Paris by train (RER) and located on the sandbank in the Seine. The small island, Ile des Impressionistes, still now reminds us of the old times when the impressionists were gathering there to have exciting discussions about their art.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, Ile des Impressionistes was a popular resort for rich Parisians who were spending their weekends enjoying boating in the Seine, and especially the restaurant in the woods, La Fournaise, was always full of vacationers. Many artists like Monet, Pissarro and Sisley also heard about the beauty of the river, light, and green in this region and gathered in this little place. Among them, it was Renoir that most successfully depicted the happy moments the people there had, and his work, “The Lunch for Boating People” (1881) represents the time well.</p>

<p>A museum restaurant, “<strong>Restaurant Fournaise</strong>,” and behind it you can find a panel of Renoir’s painting in the colorful flower garden.<br />
<strong>Fournaise Museum</strong> Official Home Page <a href="http://www.musee-fournaise.com/fournaise/us/mf040101.asp">Musee Fournaise</a><br />
<strong>*Restaurant Fournaise</strong> (Tel　01 30 71 41 91) Open only for lunch and dinner. Better to make a reservation in the summer. Around 40 euros per person.</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/malmaison/cafe.html" alt="cafe" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>There’s another restaurant opposite to the museum restaurant called “<strong>Les Rives de la Courtille</strong>,” where you can enjoy a café looking down the river.</p>
<p>The artist aged 40 who had just received recognition in the Salon fell into love with a woman carrying a puppy in her arms in the painting above. Her name is Aline. She was brought up in a countryside and was not from a rich family, but she was accepted as a model by the artists and sitting on the terrace with them on the day when she met her lifelong partner. Ten years later she became Renoir’s wife, had three children, and then devoted herself to taking care of her husband suffering from rheumatism in her last years. Renoir painted many pictures of his wife after marriage, and those paintings show us their warm and happy life.</p>
<p><strong>Information </strong><br />
<a href="http://www.chatou.fr/">Chatou Official HP</a></p>
<p><strong>Access from Paris<br />
</strong>Take RER Line A, and get off at Rueil Malmaison. It’s about a 15 minute’s ride. Walk in the direction of Chatou from the station, and you will find the staircase which leads to the riverside (about 500m). The sigh below will also help you find the way.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/malmaison/photo%20186%20(WinCE).html" alt="." width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>On the bridge there will be a sign like this two times. The first one will take you to “<strong>Impressionist Park</strong>,” and the second one will lead you to “Fournaise Museum.”</p>
<p>The Entrance of Impressionist Park</p>

These photos were taken in May. There were so many colorful flowers, and people were taking a walk in the picturesque garden.</p>

<p>You can’t imagine it is only 15 minutes away from Paris. If you are looking for somewhere calm to relax, I recommend this place. Next time I will take a pencil and paper with me to draw a picture!!</p>
