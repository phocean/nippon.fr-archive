				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Parc de Saint-Cloud</strong> :</p>
<p>Parc de Saint-Cloud is located in the southwest of Paris. It’s in the suburbs. Away from the center of Paris, people are enjoying the nature there. Picnic, reading, jogging, cycling, whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>How to Get There</strong>：</p>
<p>Take Metro 9 and ride it to the terminal, Pont de Sevres. From there you can walk to the park. It’s about five minutes. Take the bridge, and you will see Musee National de Ceramique. The park entrance is just past the museum. Tram 2 also stops at Musee de Sevres.</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/parc_de_saint_cloud/P1000858%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="" width="267" height="200" /><br />
When it’s sunny there are many people in this park.<br />
But different from the parks inside Paris,<br />
here, there is enough space for everyone.<br />
It’s a huge wood.</p>
<p>The park covers 460 hm. and has been protected as a nature reserve. It’s considered to be one of the most beautiful parks in Europe, and in 2005 the park was awarded <strong>Remarkable Gardens of France</strong>. Many trees in Parc de Saint-Cloud were once heavily damaged when a big storm struck Paris in 1999, but a lot of restoration efforts were given and still the park is receiving much care. It is really beautiful.</p>
<p>There are several remarkable gardens. One is a French style by Le Notre, one is an English, and one is called the garden of Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p><strong>History of Parc de Saint-Cloud</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/parc_de_saint_cloud/800px-Maquette_chateausaint-cloud%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
a model of Saint-Cloud Castle</p>
<p>Parc de Saint-Cloud was built on the site of Château de Saint-Cloud (or Saint-Cloud Castle). This castle was used as a residence for the Royal family and the Imperial family of the 16th century, and in 1785 LouisXVI purchased this castle for Marie Antoinette, who believed that the air in Saint-Cloud was good for her children. Then Napoleon declared war on the Prussian, and this led to occupation by a Prussian force. Paris was attacked from there. On October 13, 1870, the castle was burnt out because of the counter-fire from the French and completely razed in 1892. At the present time, only a few outbuildings remain.</p>

Refresh yourself in nature.<br />
It’s not hours away from Paris.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cassis ・</strong><strong>Calanques</strong>：</p>
<p>Cassis is the town situated in the east of Marseille. It’s a small port town, but always lively with many visitors. Around the port are the typical Provençal houses and colorful cafés. These buildings stand in the limited space with a lot of slopes, and this makes it a little difficult for drivers to reach the port.</p>
<p>The coastline between Marseille and Cassis is also very unique geographically. Several inlets called Calanques lie in the area, and they provide vacationers with excellent locations to enjoy calmness. Some cliffs are more than 300m high. Some people sunbathe on the beach, some enjoy boating, and some others enjoy rock-climbing. Everyone comes here to benefit from the nature of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The proverb says, “even if you have seen Paris, you can’t tell anything until you see Cassis.” It’s worth visiting once.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>History of Les-Baux-De-Provence</strong></p>
<p>The first human beings appeared in this area 6,000 B.C. and in the 10th century this castle was built. Pons le Jeune is one of the well-known members of Les-Baux family. His name is seen in the family documents from 934 to 981. The last member, Alix died in this castle in 1462. The history concerning this castle is very long, and many events took place between the 10th century and 15th century. Many wars, revolts and so on. However when it comes to the 16th-century Les-Baux began to enjoy its prosperity. This is the time when many architectures were made up, but unfortunately very few decorations and paintings remain.</p>
<p>In 1632 the castle was destroyed because of the trouble which was caused by a traitor. So the present deserted appearance will remind you how sad it was.<br />
<strong>The Sights of Les-Baux</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the vast image of this area will astonish you. It’s located in the north-west of Marseilles. On top of the hill is the castle. There are many small hills around here, which are called Alpilles. It’s the beginning of the Alps. You can also look down over the sea in a distance. And what I didn’t like was there was a strong wind blowing down from the Alps. They call this gale Mistral. And it was a little cold too.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/lesbaux/lesbaux2009/03-Les_Baux%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/lesbaux/6.js" /></p>
<p>You can have access to the hill by car, but the road doesn’t go up to the top. You have to park your car and climb up on foot. There are small souvenir shops at the foot of the hill and many old buildings. And those buildings will remind you of the old times. When you arrive the entrance, you pay and go into the small museum, where you can learn about the history of this area. After collecting some information, you go outside again and find some monuments. There is a huge catapult on exhibition. It’s really big. I felt very scared, imagining that people used this at this high place. When you go on further, you will find the ruined castle. It’s hard to believe that people really lived in such a place. And there are steps which lead to the top of the stone building. It’s very scary because there’s more wind on top, so I couldn’t enjoy the view. If you are not afraid of heights, I’m sure you will have a wonderful view from there.</p>

<p>Also this area has many nice restaurants and hotels. My recommendation is <strong>La Petite France</strong> (<strong>55, avenue de la Vallee des Baux-13520 LE PARADOU </strong>TEL　０４　９０　54　41　91). It stands in a small village and has a nice atmosphere. The waitress was very friendly, and when I visited this restaurant one Japanese chef was studying their cuisine, and the waitress let me in the kitchen. The Japanese chef told me that many people come to eat taking lots of time by car.</p>
<p>In 2009, I had another chance to visit Les Baux, and this time I visited a different restaurant “<strong>Ou Ravi Prouvençau</strong>”.</p>

<p>A small town located in the east of Marseilles is called “Le Castellet.” It stands on the hill, and there are many cute houses and souvenir shops in the small space. Some houses are decorated with colorful flowers. They are like pictures. You will feel like taking a picture in every alley. It’s a small place, but it takes time to see around. It gives you a feeling of traveling in the medieval time. I visited several shops selling the famous textile of Provence and a shop selling colorful room lamps. Everything is full of colors and stylish.</p>

<p>When I visited there in the summer, the first thing I realized was there were many cicadas, just like my country. Not only in the trees but in the souvenir shops! They sell many cicada character goods. Some toys have a sound device, so everywhere cicadas!!! The funny thing I found is, in Japan, they cry “min min min,” but in France “tss tss tss.” Even cicadas are French!!</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>Le castellet comes from Latin, Castellum. It was occupied by Rome before the 8th century and then by Zarasin. Furthermore, Guillaume I began to govern the region, changing it into the feudal society. One aristocrat became a new governor here and built a Castellet Castle and churches after the religious revolution occurred in Marseilles. Then, time passed, and in 1437 the city was sold to Castillon Family and belonged to the family until 1790. After the French Revolution, France took over the power.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carcassonne is a fortified town situated in the southwest of France. A French proverb says, “you can’t die before you see Carcassonne.” It is an admirable town.</p>
<p>This year (2009), I had a chance to stay here and greet the New Year. The sky was gray, and maybe visitors were not many compared to the high season. On New Year’s Day people are usually supposed to stay home with their family, so I think it was normal. My husband and I could enjoy a quiet time in one of the most popular tourist sites in France! It was a quite experience.</p>
<p>This town is divided into two areas. One is the fortified Cité, and the other one is the ville basse (or the lower city).</p>
<p>The hotel we stayed in stands on the Aude River, opposite from the Cité,<br />
<a href="http://www.hotel-destroiscouronnes.com/">TROIS COURONNES</a><br />
This hotel commands a great view of the Cité,<br />
especially at night the landscape is marvelous.<br />
It’s also romantic to take a walk at night.<br />
There is a footpath along the river.<br />
The Cité is lit up, like in the photo below.<br />
Totally different from the view in the daytime.</p>

Pont Vieux (Old Bridge)<br />
I don’t know how in summer,<br />
but in winter I hardly saw tourists on this bridge at night.<br />
100 % silent and calm.<br />
We could enjoy the small light show with no disturbance.</p>

<p><strong>History of Pont Vieux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stone bridge called Pont Vieux (or Old Bridge) was built in the Roman time as a replacement of the old one from the feudal age. The date goes back to the 14th century. The construction was already in process in 1315, and 5 years later it came to completion. Special taxes were introduced to cover the construction expenses. This bridge also has 12 arches, but each size is slightly different. Their diameters vary from 10 to 14m. What we can tell from this fact is that the construction was proceeded on and off according to the budget. In other words, these arches were built one by one, not</li>
<li>Pont Vieux was once separated into two parts by a stone arch, which means that contact between Cité and Ville-Basse was interrupted. There was an internal split involving the citizens of the two cities. However it followed that they concluded a peace treaty.</li>
<li>The looks of the bridge didn’t take much change until 1820. In those days it had a light and strong rail attached to the two sidewalks. In 1436 two arches collapsed, and restoration of other parts as well as repairs of the two arches took place in 1559. After this accident several readjustments were done, but the bridge never lost its taste. Then in 1820 the time finally came when Pont View had to accept reconstruction work that would change the original form.</li>
<li>In 1999, Carcassonne City and l’Architecte des Monuments de France examined the condition of this area, and they approved of the project to make the east side of Pont Vieux look nicer. Keeping the 13th arch on the east side, the ground was leveled and became a nice terrace. Now behind the planted trees along the foot pass there is enough space for a parking area.</li>

On the side of Cité across Pont Vieux,<br />
there is a space for picnics.<br />
Ideal to take a rest under the trees.<br />
It was not only us but other friends resting there.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000786%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
On the west side of Pont Vieux,<br />
There is a small chapell. <strong><br />
</strong>Chapelle Notre Dame de la Sante</p>
<p><strong>History of Chapelle Notre Dame de la Sante</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This chapel was built as a hospital facility in order to save people suffering from the plague. Jean de Saix donated to the construction. There was once a regular guard here because the area was very important from the strategical point of view, and this building was starting to function as a castle wall.</li>
<li>Today, we can see the number 1692 on the ceiling which tells us the date when the construction was completed.</li>
<li>Every year many believers and tourists come to see this chapel, and likewise in the past more and more people paid a visit to this hospital facility. In 1685 this chapel was expanded and a strong wall was added so that it could resist river floods.</li>

<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000809%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
Now let’s walk toward the Cité.<br />
There are two main gates to the Cité.<br />
Porte d’Aude and Porte Narbonnaise.<br />
These photos above were taken from the side of Porte d’Aude.<br />
The view from below the buildings is very powerful.<br />
The church standing below the hill is Eglise Saint Gimer.</p>
<p><strong>History of Eglise Saint Gimer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A young man named Eugène Viollet-le-Duc discovered Carcassone. It was 1831 when he was going on an expedition to the Pyrenees. After visiting Italy, he was most likely to show up in Carcassonne again in 1839. He was charged to write a report about restoration work of Saint-Nazaire in 1843, and the following year he became a supervisor for the work. The relation between Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and Carcassonne lasted until 1879 when he died.</li>
<li>Viollet-le-Duc was in charge of 4 construction sites, and Saint-Gimer is the least known of the four. Although he played an important role as an architect at the time, he is now rather considered to be a renovator. This is because he could realize only 3 churches in his career; Saint-Denis de l’Estrée, Aillant-sur-Tholon and Saint-Gimer。</li>
<li>Saint Gimer was built from 1854 to 1859, and being simple was one of the objectivities in this construction. Viollet-le-Duc wanted to realize genuine work within the budget.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History of Porte d’Aude </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Aude gate stands below the cliff and its castle wall once guarded the area around the riverside. This wall dates back to the 13th century. The Aude gate was made in the wall of Visigoths in the 12th century. It has an arch form, and the interior brings us back the atmosphere which it used to have.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000720%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
This is Porte Narbonnaise<br />
On the other side of Porte d’Aude</p>
<p><strong>History of Porte Narbonnaise</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Porte Narbonnaise is situated in the east of the Cité. This gate was built to raise dignity and enhance comfort, and these elements were well integrated into military establishments.</li>
<li>From 16th century, this fortified castle was starting to lose symbolic power, and to maintain the fame several legends were appearing. One of the most famous stories is <strong>Dame Carcas</strong>. When the Cité was occupied by Saracens, Charlemagne kept attacking the Cité for 5 years. Dame Carcas, who lost her husband, grand duke, led the Cité order. The attack continued and the people in the Cité were running short of provisions and water. Then, Dame Carcas tried to make a list of what was left in the Cité. One citizen brought one pig and wheat, and she came up with an idea. She let the pig eat the wheat and threw it outside the Cité. When Charlemagne found the pig, he thought that there must be still enough food inside the Cité, and he withdrew. People rang all the bells in the Cité to celebrate the victory. One of the soldiers on the way of withdrawal noted down 《 Sire, Carcas te sonne 》. It means “Carcas is ringing the bell”. 《Carcas sonne 》, that is, Carcassonne! This is the origin of the city name. The statue of Carcas stands at Porte Narbonnaise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s go through the gate and see the inside of the Cité.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000723%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
<strong>Joseph Poux</strong> (1873－1938）<br />
Joseph Poux is the historian who studied this fortified castle.</p>
<p><strong>History of 2500 years of Carcassonne</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the 6th century BC Celtics settled here, and it developed to be a city in the Roman time.</li>
<li>In the 3rd century BC a strong castle wall was starting to be built.</li>
<li>In 435, it became part of Visigoth.</li>
<li>From 725 to 759 Muslims occupation, and then by Franks.</li>
<li>In the feudal age, Trencavel dynasty began.</li>
<li>In 1208 the Cité became the king’s territory. Trencavel II tried to take back the Cité but failed.</li>
<li>1997 registered as a UNESCO world heritage</li>

The castle wall is reinforced double,<br />
and it’s 3,000m long.<br />
There are 52 towers.</p>

<strong>Grand Puits</strong><br />
The oldest well in the Cité.<br />
There is a legend that treasure is hidden in this well.<br />
But never found.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000766%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000828%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
Many shops inside the Cité now.<br />
I bought some cookies to fill my stomach.<br />
Many souvenir shops, cafés and restaurants too.</p>

<strong>Basilique Saint-Nazaire </strong><br />
There are many figures like this on this church.<br />
To prevent evil?</p>
<p>I had a little more time to look around the Cité and found some interesting things. I’ll show you some of them.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000774%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /></p>

<strong>Maison dite « de Montmorency » </strong><br />
The house named Montmorency.<br />
Built in the 16th century.<br />
The first base is made of stone,<br />
the other three floors are made of wood.<br />
The wood helps support the wall made of sand.</p>

<strong>Notre-Dame de l’Abbabye </strong><br />
Strange paintings.<br />
Look, it’s got three legs?</p>
<p>It is also known as a place<br />
where Christians in Carcassonne gathered for the first time.</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/carcassonne/p1000787%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
This is the street I found in Carcassonne.<br />
RUE TRANQUILLE<br />
Indeed, it was a quiet night when I visited there.</p>
<p>It was a short trip, but there were many spots to see and I walked a lot! Most of the shops and hotels are found in the lower city, but you can find a few good hotels and restaurants in the Cité too. If you prefer to eat and stay inside the Cité, you’d better make a reservation, of course. The list of the accommodations and restaurants in Carcassonne is found at Carcassonne tourism official website. They can send you a city map and a guide booklet, or you can download them at their website. They also show more details about history for each spot in their homepage. I suggest you studying a little about the history before your trip. It’s good to know it, and you will enjoy your trip more.</p>
<p>I found people there nice and friendly. A nice landscape and nice food too. Don’t forget to taste their specialties!!! Food from the southwest of France is known to be one of the best in France.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Day we had dinner at a Brasserie near the station because we didn’t make any plan for this trip except a hotel. Actually we didn’t expect anything special. We were kind of giving up on food, but they serve excellent food. They had a special menu for the day too. After the meal they gave us a small sachet of chocolate as a New Year’s Day gift. They made my day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We spent our New Year’s Day 2008 in a small village called Eze, which I’d long wanted to visit.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Eze ？</strong><br />
Eze is the village standing on the rocky hill between Nice and Monaco.</p>
<p><a href="../../imgs/eze/IMAGE0160%20%5B800x600%5D.JPG"><img src="../../imgs/eze/IMAGE0160%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="eze map" width="320" height="225" /></a><br />
a postcard I bought in Eze<br />
click on the card, and you get a larger image.</p>
<p>The town is situated on a craggy hill that looks like a nest of an eagle, and it’s got another name “nid d’aigle” (eagle’s nest). The high cliff is located 427m above sea level on the French Mediterranean, and it gives you a great panoramic view of the French Riviera. It’s just breathtaking.</p>
<p>First, we arrived at Eze station at the foot of the cliff rising to the sky. There were no other people around except us, and there were not many buses available, either. We were a little worried about our situation… One hour passed at the bus stop before our bus came. After the long wait and patience, we finally got relieved and retrieved our hope. The bus driver saved us!</p>
<p>The higher the bus went, the wider the view, and the more people there were. The bus driver had a great art of controlling his bus on the meandering road.</p>
<p>How is it possible to drive in such condition, and how is it possible they pass each other on such a road!</p>
<p>It was about ten minutes before we reached the village on the hill, and we found that most of the tourists here came by car. Especially we saw many sightseeing buses parked on the street…</p>
<p>We expected a quiet place there, but actually there were many people thinking the same thing as we were. On Christmas and New Year’s Day, more people come here to stay and have dinner at some prestigious hotels, but between the two events, I think it’s rather quiet. We came after Christmas, so for the first few days it was OK, but after New Year’s Eve it was very difficult to find a table at a restaurant.</p>

<p><strong>The history of Eze</strong><br />
Eze had a prosperous time in the Roman time and was integrated into Genoa and Monaco in the medieval time. Until 1861 when it became a territory of France, Eze was also part or the Kingdom of Sardinia and was called Eza in Italian. Under such various influences, this small village has attained the unique atmosphere that contains both French and Italian cultures. Their road signs are written in both languages, and the people also speak the two languages. Furthermore, Eze people have or had some dialects. They say it was close to the Monegasque language used in Monaco, and that it was related to the Ligurian language and the Occitan language.</p>
<p>The Egyptian cross that is kept in the church also tells us that the village history dates back to the time of the Phoenicians, who built a temple to worship the goddess Isis. I found the village symbol while I was walking on the street (the picture below). It reads “Isis Moriendo Renascor” (meaning “In death I am Reborn”). You see a Phoenix perched on a bone. This is the village motto.</p>
<p><a href="../../imgs/eze/pc300160%20%5B800x600%5D.js" /></a><br />

<p><strong>Sightseeing in Eze</strong><br />
Eze is very famous for the wonderful view overlooking the French Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The oldest building in Eze is <strong>the Chapelle de la Sainte Croix</strong>, which was built in 1306. People then had meetings there to discuss how to give assistance to plague victims. The shape of the church bell shows that the village once belonged to the Republic of Genoa.</p>
<p>I also found an interesting fountain.</p>
<p>It was made in 1930 and was the only fountain in the village. Before that time, the villagers had to carry a tank of water from the town at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/eze/pc300072%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /></p>
<p>Inside the village are some souvenir shops, art galleries, famous rich hotels and restaurants. It’s like a small museum, and there are no locals who live here any more.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/eze/pc300167%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /></p>

<p><strong>Fragonard</strong> has an outlet shop here in Eze. If you like perfume, you may find something nice.<br />
Visit their home page : <a href="http://www.fragonard.com/">Fragonard</a></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/eze/p1010007%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
I bought one for souvenir!</p>
<p>The village also has a botanical garden, which is famous for the great view of the sea, but when we visited there it was closed. Check the details at the official web site.</p>
<p><strong>Eze at night</strong><br />
If you think of a few days staying in the village, I recommend your walking at night. It’s gorgeous. Maybe it’s because we were there at Christmas time, but I still think it’s more beautiful at night. Avoid the high season, and you’ll appreciate a quiet and peaceful moment there. During the daytime, there are too many visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Hotels/Restaurants in Eze</strong><br />
Here in Eze, there are some worldwide famous hotels. Among them are <strong>Chateau de La Chevre d’Or</strong> and<strong> Chateau Eza</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/eze/pc300161%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
<strong>Chateau de La Chevre d’Or</strong><br />

<strong>Chateau Eza</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.chateaueza.com/">Homepage</a></p>
<p>They both have four stars. We couldn’t afford several nights at such an expensive hotel, but we had a gorgeous dinner at Chateau Eza. They have a terrace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. What we had that night was Degustation Course €105. I was very excited, but at the same time, very nervous… Too good, too stylish for us. It was my first experience to have pre-dessert, dessert and post-dessert (I don’t know what I should call them, but three times I had dessert time).</p>
<p>And, this is the hotel we stayed in.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/eze/pc310006%20%5B320x200%5D.js" /><br />
<strong>Hotel Restaurant Eze Hermitage</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.ezehermitage.com/">Homepage</a></p>
<p>This hotel stands on the place higher than Eze village. It’s a little far to get there on foot, but Bus 83 takes you to the hotel directly. The hotel is the terminal, “Plateau de la Justice”. It’s about 10 minutes. It stops at Eze village, too. Only one bus every hour.</p>
<p>Their restaurant also has a good reputation. They have three stars.</p>
<p><strong>Hiking</strong><br />
Eze Hermitage has a negative point of being away from Eze village, but we found a great point of this hotel while staying there. One day we were walking around the hotel, because they said there were some nice hiking courses around, and we did find some nice view points. Look at the pictures we took there. Can you imagine it’s New Year’s Day!!</p>

In the north you see the Alps.<br />
This is the sunrise on New Year’s Day in Eze.</p>
<p><strong>How to get to Eze </strong><br />
Many tourists stop by at Eze on the way to Monaco or Nice by car. We used TGV from Marseille to Cannes, and at Cannes we took a local train to Eze (the station name is “Eze Bord de la Mer”）.</p>
<p>Arriving at “Eze Bord de la Mer”, we first found the tourist office. Unfortunately it was closed during the winter vacation, but it’s good to know. You can take Bus 83 to Eze village or Eze Hermitage Hotel (only one bus every one hour/€1.30), or you can call a taxi. At the tourist office two taxi drivers’ numbers are given (but remember, they don’t work during the winter vacation/€30 to Eze). From Nice, Bus 82 is available. It goes to Eze Hermitage Hotel and Eze village, too.</p>
<p>It’s a little difficult to reach there if you don’t have a car, but it’s still possible to get there in other ways.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How to Get to Vincennes</strong><br />
Vincennes is situated in the southeast of Paris, and it is still accessible by Metro. Take Line 1 and get off the train at the east terminal, Chteau de Vincennes.</p>
<p>The admission fee is 7.90 euros.</p>

<p><strong>The history of Vincennes</strong><br />
Vincenne is the castle for the kings between the 14th and 17th century.</p>
<p>Like many other castles, it was originally built as a lodge for Louis VII to use when he went hunting. Then in the 13th century, Philippe II Auguste and Louis IX added more and more parts and built it into a manor. It is also said that Louis IX never returned after he left Vincennes for the crusade expedition. Moreover, the castle tower was constructed by Philippe VI, and the structure was the highest and strongest in the medieval times (52m high). The castle walls surrounding the tower were built in 1410.</p>
<p>Vincennes castle was not only a fort but also a place where some kings had a wedding ceremony, like Philippe III (1274) and Philippe VI (1322). In addition, the kings in the 14th century were all born in Vincennes: Louis X (1316), Philippe V (1322) and Charles IV (1328).</p>
<p>In the 17th century, after Versailles started to draw attention, Vincennes was also converted into a prison where many important people were kept.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, the castle was abandoned. After that, first the site was used as a pottery, and then as an official prison,　and in 1796 people began to use the site as a military establishment. At present, it is part of the historic section of the French Arms Services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the 19th century, a British-style garden was created. Napoleon III released the forest of Vincennes and the castle as a public park in 1860.</p>
<p>In 1940, the castle experienced World War II, as well. The French army placed the military base here.</p>
<p><strong>Chateau de Vincennes</strong><br />
After 12 years of renovation period, the castle unveiled the appearance to the public again in 2007. When I visited here six years ago, it was still under construction, and I have wanted to come back again since then.</p>

Inside the tall tower is rather limited in space,<br />
and you can see how the life in the past was.</p>

In the past, the rooms were colorfully decorated.</p>
<p><strong>Ground Floor</strong><br />
In the medieval times, this ground floor allowed access only through a small staircase. The door to the courtyard was made in the 18th century. So, at that time, it was difficult to use this floor as a kitchen, and instead it was used as a storage and a room for servants. In this room there is a well and a trace of fireplace.</p>
<p>The window fences and the door to the cell were made in the 19th century, and their presence tells us that this room was once used as a prison. However, in 1784 all prisoners were sent to Bastille, and Vincennes became free from the dark history. Between 1785 and 1790 a bakery shop that was supplying Vincennes Village and the East Paris District occupied the courtyard.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vincennes/P7080035%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="v" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><strong>The Marquis de Sade’s cell</strong><br />
A hedonist, philosopher, atheist and scandalous provocative author, Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade, was infamous for his salacious works. He was imprisoned in Vincennes twice. First for his violence in a brothel, and then for poisoning a prostitute. He was sentenced to death. He spent here 7 years, and was taken to Bastille, and then was freed in 1790.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vincennes/P7080039%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="v" width="320" height="240" /> <img src="../../imgs/vincennes/P7080040%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="v" width="150" height="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Prison in Vincennes </strong><br />
From the medieval times, the kings had a place to imprison prisoners in their residence in order to play a role of a judicial officer. In the late 15th, Louis XI started to use this castle tower as a prison. In the 16th century, the prison became official, and many heretics like Protestants and political opponents were arrested and confined in here.</p>
<p>Pierre Ernst I of Mansfeld (1517~1604) was imprisoned in Vincennes as a prisoner of war, but he was allowed to cook and do household work. He even had a hare and a parrot as his pets. Then soon after the ransom was paid he was released.</p>
<p>From the 17th, prisoners were put in a cell, like Nicola Fouquet. In 1661, he was imprisoned by Louis XIV. (see the page <a href="../../tourism_en/vaux_le_vicomte.html">Vaux-le-Vicomte</a>)</p>
<p>From the late 18th century, Bastille became a symbolic royal prison. Some prisoners were taken here with no trial. In 1749, Diderot was sent to Bastille because his work was considered subversive.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, after the Revolutions, some deposed dignitaries were kept in Vincennes, and until World War II it was used as a prison.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vincennes/P7080043%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="v" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><strong>Sculpture decorations </strong><br />
Decoration of sculpture is heavily used on the bases of the windows, and it is full of fantasy like an angel playing music. These sculptures were duplicated when the building was reconstructed, but the original works are also displayed in the castle. The motif of an angel playing music was often used in sculpture, stained glass, and paintings in the medieval Europe. It was used as the symbol of the heaven at that time.</p>

<p><strong>A bell and a clock</strong><br />
The bell tower made in 1369 is the first public clock. The tower standing now here was rebuilt in 2000. The original bell is placed in La Sainte Chapelle (see the page <a href="../../tourism_en/sainte_chapelle.html">La Sainte Chapelle</a>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Château de Vaux-Le-Vicomte</strong></p>
<p>Vaux-le-Vicomte is the castle which was built by Nicola Fouquet, who was the Lord high treasurer of Louis XIV in the 17th century. The castle is known as one of the most modern and elegant masterpieces that none of other royal properties could compete with. The young Sun King was so irritated by Fouquet’s fortune and condemned him to life imprisonment. Versailles Place was then built based on the great inspiration from Vaux-le_Vicomte.</p>
<p><strong>How to Get to Vaux-Le-Vicomte</strong></p>
<p>Taking RER D at Metro Chatret or at Gare de Lyon, you reach the terminal station Melun, and there goes a shuttle bus to the castle. It costs 7 euro for a round-trip ticket, and the bus is available only on weekends between April and October. If you need more details, check their official site. It is a 20-minute ride from Melun station to the castle.</p>
<p><a href="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/IMAGE0020.JPG"><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/IMAGE0020%20%5BiPod%20Photo%5D.JPG" alt="map" width="220" height="164" /></a><br />
<a href="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/IMAGE0020.JPG">click to enlarge </a></p>
<p><strong>The interior of the castle </strong></p>
<p><strong>Les Charmilles </strong><br />
First you see in the compound a castle restaurant open on weekdays between May and October. Weather permitting, it will be nice having lunch under the sun.</p>
<p><strong>The Carriage Museum</strong><br />
Farther you walk on, you’ll hit the building which exhibits a collection of horse carriages. The yellow carriage you see in the photo below is the one which is specially designed to contain game after hunting. All carriages are taken good care of and shiny.</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010024%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="cart" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><strong>Château de Vaux-Le-Vicomte</strong></p>
<p>The castle is surrounded by the moat, and the presence of water gives visitors a little break in the dry weather.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010118%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="castle" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>Inside the building there are many things to see. Many old books and paintings, and each item tells us what the life in the past was like and how Nicola Fouquet spent his life. This is the painting which shows the scene when Nicola Fouquet was tried in the court. We can tell from this that the power of the king was absolute.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010032%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="trial" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>Jean de la Fontaine, a fable writer, who had his association with Nicola Fouquet, was one of the contemporaries. In France, he has been admired for his contribution to the introduction of Aesop’s Fables and more stories of his own. In the middle of the absolute monarchism, it was impossible to criticize the king directly, so he did so using a character of a lion in his story as a symbol of the king.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010027%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="writer" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010028%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="book" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>This is the bathroom at that time. The thing which looks like a long chair in the middle of the room is a bathtub, and the small pots were used to serve hot water. One more thing that is interesting to know is the chair on the right side which has a hole on it. It is a toilet!</p>
<p>And the photo on the right is the bedroom. Can you see how small the people in the past? I can’t stretch my legs on such a tiny bed!!</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010036%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="bathroom" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010037%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="bedroom" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>This is Fouquet’s study room. I wonder what kind of books he was reading in this room.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010040%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="den" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010055%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="den" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>The buffet room is Fouquet’s old dining room. Before his time, all meals had been carried to a master’s room or a guest room, so this is the first buffet room in the history. The right photo shows his wine cave.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010062%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="buffet" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010069%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="wine" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>Have you ever heard the legend of Iron Mask? In the time of Louis XIV, one strange prisoner with an iron mask on was living. The story tells that the mask was locked and the man never spoke. People who saw his face were all executed as well. One hypothesis is that the man might be a twin brother of Louis XIV, but the truth is all in the dark. And did Fouquet know about the man?</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010066%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="mask legend" width="265" height="196" /> <img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010068%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="mask" width="150" height="200" /></p>
<p>There are still more rooms in the castle, including an observatory, Dome visit. Keep in mind that this castle is the model of Versailles, so that you will find many similarities.</p>
<p><strong>The Garden of Vaux-le-Vicomte </strong><br />
The designer of this garden is Le Notre, who was also in charge of creating Versailles Palace later. He was given a symbolic designation of cabbage and snails in honor of his great work. You can learn more about him in the room of Le Notre exhibition.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010080%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="le notre" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010082%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="le notre" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>After studying about the creator of this garden, you go outside to see the garden itself. Everything in this garden is well calculated and measured. It is the garden created by force of mathematics.</p>
<p>The big water fountains placed in the middle of the garden make the real distance look shorter. You think it is not so far, but in reality it is pretty far. It is fun to walk thinking about the trick.</p>
<p><img src="../../imgs/vaux_le_vicomte/P5010085%20%5B320x200%5D.JPG" alt="garden" width="320" height="240" /></p>

<p>They have a firework festival here in the summer.<br />
It must be very beautiful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One and a half hour after leaving Paris at Gare de l’Est, we arrived at Reims in Champagne-Ardenne region. “Champagne” comes from here in France, and from the train we saw vast vine yards everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>the History of Reims</strong></p>
<p>・In 498, Clovis in the Frankish Empire was baptized by Rémi, the bishop of Reims, and after that 10 successive French kings were crowned here.</p>
<p>・During the Second World War, Reims was occupied by Germany and received a lot of damage.</p>
<p>・ In 1991 Notre-Dame de Reims was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. This is one of the three greatest Cathedrals (another one is <a href="../../tourism_en/chartres.html">Chartres</a>) in France, where Charles VII was consecrated. It is also well-known that Joan of Arc attended the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>World Heritage in Reims </strong></p>

About 10 minutes on foot from Reims Station. The cathedral is standing in the middle of the city.<br />
It was damaged by the German Army, but it is still grand enough to overwhelm visitors.</p>

The interior is also breathtaking.<br />
I wonder how in the past such a cathedral was designed and actually erected.</p>

Around Pl. Drouet d’Erlon there are many restaurants.<br />
And we ate the specialty, choucroute, in this region.<br />
Pork, sausage, bacon, ham with vinegared cabbage.<br />
This is for 2 persons (30 euros), but it must be for 3 or 4 people!</p>

<p><img src="../../imgs/reims/arches%20%28WinCE%29.JPG" alt="arch" width="240" height="180" /><br />
Near the station, we found <strong>Port Mars</strong> which was made in the 3rd century.<br />
It’s a remain from the Roman time.</p>
<p>Walking farther toward the east, a famous champagne factory named G.H.MUMM is standing on Rue du Champ de Mars.</p>

<p>The name comes from a Japanese artist, Tsuguharu Fujita. He liked painting from his childhood and wished to study new art in France some day. After divorcing his first wife, he decided to leave Japan. He arrived in Paris in the 1930s and succeeded in making a name for himself. However, World War II was going to break out and Paris was going to be occupied by Germany, so he went back to Japan.</p>
<p>Back in Japan, he was forced to produce war pictures for propaganda under the orders of the Japanese Government. He created some paintings which were said to be beyond the war pictures in quality, but after the war ended he was accused of cooperating for the war.</p>
<p>He was disgusted by the action and again left Japan for France, and there he met the manager of G.H.MUMM, who also baptized him. He restarted his life as Leonard Tsuguharu Foujita</p>
<p>In 1966 he created a fresco painting for MUMM in return, and designed the chapel building, sculptures, and stained glass as well. It was when he was 80 years old, and two years later he died of cancer in Switzerland. His body is sleeping under the chapel now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lovagny</strong> is about 10 km away from Annecy, and in the city the gorges called <strong>Les Gorges du Fier</strong> share the cool with visitors who come here to escape from the summer heat. These gorges were officially recognized as a precious scenic spot in 1943.</p>
<p><strong>Fier</strong> is one of the major rivers in Haute-Savoie prefecture, and its source is found on the south edge of <strong>Le Mont-Charvin</strong> (Mt. Charvin). The water is running 2019m deep under the summit. Then the water flows to the north from a small lake in the Alps, and reaches the alpine pasture basin, which is well moistened by the snow water. Then again it goes on about 70 km and meets <strong>Le Rhone </strong>(Rhone River) at <strong>Chateaufort</strong>. The river runs through the valleys called <strong>Manigod</strong> and <strong>Thones</strong>, and passes the Annecy plain and finally <strong>le chateau de Montrottier </strong>(Montrottier Castle). And there you can see the beauty of nature which is created as a result of erosion by the water. It is said to be the most mysterious creation of nature in France.</p>

<p>20,000 years ago, the glacier, which was supposed to become a lake in Annecy later, extended as long as 30 km. When the ice began to melt, a great amount of water was produced, and it is said that the surface of the lake was 15m higher than the present level. The water, then, is directed toward Le chateau de Montrottier (Montrottier Castle), forming a river, and the flow changes its course after it hits soft rocks there. And over thousands of years with the process, <strong>Les Gorges du Fier</strong> have been formed.</p>

<p>In October 1868, the project to build up a visitors’ gallery was started, bringing it to completion in July 1869. It was dangerous work in which workers had to be hung in a barrel in the air using the system of a pulley in order to drive iron supports for a walk way on the rock. It was built on the left side of the gorge. It is 252m long and 20~30m above the river surface. The gorge itself is 70m deep.</p>

People swimming in the nearby river.</p>
<p>It was a thrilling experience, since I’m afraid of heights. The cold of the air and the fear both cooled me a lot. If you seek a cool place in the summer, this could be one of the places.</p>
